# Swiss

A Swiss style blog theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org). Used on my personal blog [yige.ch](http://yige.ch).

# Usage

Copy the theme folder to `your-ghost-blog/content/themes` and restart your blog. You will see the theme after loggin in to your blog again.

You may want to change the icon images in `assets/`, the Google Analytics code and the search box code in `default.hbs` at first, though.
