# Swiss

A Swiss style blog theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org). Used on my personal blog [yige.ch](http://yige.ch).

# Usage

Copy the project folder to `your-ghost-blog/content/themes` on your blog server and restart your Ghost service. You will see the "Swiss" theme in blog settings after loggin in to your blog again.

You may want to change the icon images in `assets/`, the Google Analytics code and the search box code in `default.hbs` before using this theme for you own blog.
